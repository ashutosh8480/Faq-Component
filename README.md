# Frequently-Asked-Questions-in-JavaScript
The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page can improve user experience. All websites should have an FAQ page because it reduces the time your employees need to answer simple questions. It allows visitors to find answers to all their questions in one place. And an FAQ page can be a great source of content ideas.

It can expand or collapse to display the content it contains.
